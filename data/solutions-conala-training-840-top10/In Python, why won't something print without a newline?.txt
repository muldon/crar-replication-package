Query: In Python, why won't something print without a newline?

 If you add "\n" then stream is flushed automaticaly, and it is not without new line at the end.
You can flush output with:   sys.stdout.flush()

 You can just add  ,  in the end of  print  function so it won't print on new line.

 Because  stdout  is buffered. You may be able to force the output sooner with a  sys.stdout.flush()  call.

 It should be as simple as described at this link by Guido Van Rossum: 

 Re: How does one print without a c/r ? 

 http://legacy.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1992/0115.html 

 
   Is it possible to print something but not automatically have a
  carriage return appended to it ? 
 

 Yes, append a comma after the last argument to print. For instance,
this loop prints the numbers 0..9 on a line separated by spaces. Note
the parameterless "print" that adds the final newline: 

  >>> for i in range(10):
...     print i,
... else:
...     print
...
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
>>>

 Use  print item,  to make the print statement omit the newline. 

 In Python 3, it's  print(item, end=" ") . 

 If you want every number to display in the same place, use for example (Python 2.7): 

  to = 20
digits = len(str(to - 1))
delete = "\b" * (digits + 1)
for i in range(to):
    print "{0}{1:{2}}".format(delete, i, digits),
  

 In Python 3, it's a bit more complicated; here you need to flush  sys.stdout  or it won't print anything until after the loop has finished: 

  import sys
to = 20
digits = len(str(to - 1))
delete = "\b" * (digits)
for i in range(to):
   print("{0}{1:{2}}".format(delete, i, digits), end="")
   sys.stdout.flush()

 It's because output in Python is buffered by default - ordinarily you won't get the output until the buffer is full or something causes the buffer to be flushed. In this case the  \n  was sensed and caused an automatic flush. 

 See this question for ways around the problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/230751/how-to-flush-output-of-python-print

 Consider that when you type a command into a computer, it doesn't know  you're finished  until you press ENTER 

 Similarly, the newline tells Python you've finished that line.

 In Python 3, print is now a function. It will print a new line character at the end of your statement.  

 If you don't specify an "end" it will by default use a new line character.  

 You can prevent this by doing something such as: 

  print("hello world", end="")

 The sys.stdout.write command from the sys module purposefully prints out the statement without the \n character. This is how a normal call to the stdout stream works, such as in C++ or C, where the \n character must be added manually. 

 However the print command provided by Python automatically adds a \n character to the string, therefore simplifying the code and making it easier to read. 

 The reason the phenomenon in the first result happens is because the system is waiting for a flush to print out, which is provided by the \n character. You can avoid this by using this command,  sys.stdout.flush() , which will flush the stdout stream which forces it to print.

 There's an implied newline after the  print  finishes, which causes a newline immediately after the  \b  is echoed. This causes the cursor to move to the next line, so there won't be anything overwriting the  c  from the previous line. 

 If you did something like: 

  print 'abc\b', 'def'
  

 you would see output like: 

  ab def
  

 i.e. it's not 'invalid' at the end of a sentence, it's just that because you immediately print a newline, nothing gets an opportunity to overwrite the character that backspaced into. 

 To make this a little bit more clear (hopefully) - taken by typing the lines into python directly: 

 print adds the newline, if we use  sys.stdout.write , it won't add a newline automatically: 

  >>> import sys
>>> sys.stdout.write('abc')
abc>>> sys.stdout.write('abc\b')
ab>>>
