 Check out:
http://commons.apache.org/io/ 

 It has copy, and as stated the JDK already has move. 

 Don't implement your own copy method.  There are so many floating out there...

  java.io.File  is a relatively simple class introduced in 1.0. JDK 1.0 didn't have much in it - mostly related to support for applets and the javac compiler. I guess there hasn't been a great deal of pressure to expand it - applets and enterprise software are not oriented in that direction. 

 However, lots has been added to I/O for JDK7. Including [ java.nio.file.Path.copyTo ][1].

 Copy that jar file to: 

 
   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk\jre\lib\ext  
 

 and 

 
   C:\Program Files\Java\jre\lib\ext 
 

 You should be able to use it in Netbeans and in your manual imports, just like standard imports.

 yes you can copy the installation directory, only change you need to do is to change you JAVA_HOME and PATH variable accordingly...

 If by "native" you mean "part of the Java standard API" (rather than platform-dependant code, which is usually called "native" in the Java world) and by "copy files" you mean "single method that takes a file and a target path and produces a copy of the file's contents" then no, there is no such method in the standard API. You have to open an  InputStream  and an  OutputStream  (optionally get their more efficient  FileChannel s) and use a buffer to transfer bytes. Convenient single methods to call are found in http://commons.apache.org/io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html. 

  Update:  Since Java 7, file copy functionality has become part of the Standard API in  java.nio.file.Files

 Search for the  vecmath  file, you may find it in  /usr/share/java . 

 Copy the contents of this folder to  /jdk_installation_folder/jre/lib/ext . 

 For me, it is  /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/ext . 

 To copy you can use either the  cp -command or change the  ext  folder permission to  777  using  chmod . 

  $ chmod 777 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/ext
  

 Then copy all the files in file explorer. 

  $ chmod 755 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/ext
  

 If you do did not find the  vecmath.jar  file, then download and install it.  

  apt-get install libvecmath-java

 This is how I do it,  

 Start with the exe installation and wait for the below screen, 

 https://i.stack.imgur.com/BGSfH.png 

 Go to the  C:\Program Files (x86)\Java  and copy your JDK to another place. 

 Cancel the installation by clicking 'x' and uninstall JDK. 

 Copy the copied JDK back into  C:\Program Files (x86)\Java  or other folder of your choice

 go to your jdk path where you installed your java 

 For e.g In my PC JDK installed in the following path 

 "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_17\"; 

 After go to the lib folder e.g "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_17\lib" 

 in the lib directory there is tool.jar file 

 Copy this file and past it in the lib forlder of jre7 directory
for e.g 

 "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib"

 I found that even though my path is set to JDK, the ant wants the tools.jar from jre folder. So just copy paste the tools.jar folder from JDK to jre.
