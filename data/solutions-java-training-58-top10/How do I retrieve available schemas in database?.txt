 If it's Oracle, then run the below query using JDBC 

  SELECT YOUR_SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL

 The best solution is to insert a record, then get generated keys, and then rollback the transaction.
It works on all databases with transaction and auto-number support.

 Try following: 

  puplic class MyClass {
  public static final String S1D="S1D";
  public static final String S2D="S2D";
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "TABLE1", schema=MyClass.S1D)
...

@Entity
@Table(name = "TABLE2", schema=MyClass.S2D)
...

 http://www.liquibase.org/ has http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/diff.html. But I don't know if there is an API, or just the tool.

 You can retrieve general information about the structure of a database with the java.sql.DatabaseMetaData interface. 

  DatabaseMetaData dbmeta = con.getMetaData();
  

 call getColumns(), to get description of table columns available.

 Actually the parameter spring.session.jdbc.schema does not means the "database schema", but the SQL schema (the SQL that defines the data structure where the session data is stored). 

 The schemas for different DBs are available at:

 JDBC is the only Java API that deals with databases. 

 You'd have to connect to both, get their respective DatabaseMetaData, and compare the two.

 It depends on the flav of the RDBMS. MariaDB (MySQL) have LAST_INSERT_ID() function which gives you the last value of an AUTO_INCREMENT field. 

 Databases that suppt sequences (say Ingres) allow you to get next value with something like: 

  SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR some_sequence;
  

   

  SELECT some_sequence.NEXTVAL;

 You need to http://poi.apache.org/faq.html#faq-N10025. Specifically, from the http://poi.apache.org/faq.html#faq-N10025: 

 
   To use the new OOXML file formats, POI requires a jar containing the file format XSDs, as compiled by XMLBeans. These XSDs, once compiled into Java classes, live in the org.openxmlformats.schemas namespace. 
  
   There are two jar files available, as described in the components overview section. The full jar of all of the schemas is ooxml-schemas-1.3.jar, and it is currently around 15mb. The smaller poi-ooxml-schemas jar is only about 4mb. This latter jar file only contains the typically used parts though. 
  
   Many users choose to use the smaller poi-ooxml-schemas jar to save space. However, the poi-ooxml-schemas jar only contains the XSDs and classes that are typically used, as identified by the unit tests. Every so often, you may try to use part of the file format which isn't included in the minimal poi-ooxml-schemas jar. In this case, you should switch to the full ooxml-schemas-1.3.jar. Longer term, you may also wish to submit a new unit test which uses the extra parts of the XSDs, so that a future poi-ooxml-schemas jar will include them. 
 

 So, short term, you just need to switch from the  poi-ooxml-schemas  jar to the larger (and complete)  ooxml-schemas  jar  ooxml-schemas-1.3.jar . Longer term, you need to submit a junit test to the Apache POI project which uses your desired CT class, and that class will then be automatically included in the smaller  poi-ooxml-schemas  jar in a future release.

 From the http://poi.apache.org/faq.html#faq-N10192: 

 
    I can't seem to find the source for the OOXML CT..   
  
   The OOXML support in Apache POI is built on top of the file format XML Schemas, as compiled into Java using XMLBeans. Currently, the compilation is done with XMLBeans 2.3, for maximum compatibility with installations. (You can use the resulting classes on the XMLBeans 2.3 runtime, or any later version of XMLBeans. If you are currently using XMLBeans 2.2 or earlier, you will unfortunately have to upgrade, but this isn't common any more). 
  
   All of the org.openxmlformats.schemas.spreadsheetml.x2006 CT... classes are auto-generated by XMLBeans. The resulting generated Java goes in the ooxml-schemas-src jar, and the compiled version into the ooxml-schemas jar. 
  
   The full ooxml-schemas jar is distributed with Apache POI, along with the cut-down poi-ooxml-schemas jar containing just the common parts. The source jar isn't normally distributed with POI. It is, however, available from Maven Central - ask your favourite Maven mirror for the ooxml-schemas-src jar. Alternately, if you download the POI source distribution (or checkout from SVN) and build, Ant will automatically download the specification XML Schema, and compile it for you to generate the source and binary ooxml-schemas jars. 
 

 So, if you really want the source, you can grab the source code for Apache POI and use the build tools to recreate the auto-generated source files. If you want the docs, you need to go and read the published Microsoft file format documentation, as the ooxml-schemas jars are just auto-generated from the published specs!
