Query: Two values from one input in python?

 The easiest way that I found for myself was using split function with input
Like you have two variable a,b 

  a,b=input("Enter two numbers").split()
  

 That's it.
there is one more method(explicit method)
Eg- you want to take input in three values 

  value=input("Enter the line")
a,b,c=value.split()
  

 ..

 You have to use the  split()  method which splits the input into two different inputs. Whatever you pass into the split is looked for and the input is split from there. . 

 For example, You give the input  23 24 25 . You expect 3 different inputs like 

  num1 = 23
num2 = 24
num3 = 25
  

 So in Python, You can do 

  num1,num2,num3 = input().split(" ")

 For  n  number of inputs declare the variable as an empty list and use the same syntax to proceed: 

  >>> x=input('Enter value of a and b').split(",")
Enter value of a and b
1,2,3,4
>>> x
['1', '2', '3', '4']

 This is a sample code to take two inputs seperated by split command and delimiter as "," 

 

  >>> var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").split(',')  
 >>>enter two numbers:2,3  
 >>> var1  
 '2'  
 >>> var2  
 '3'  

 

 Other variations of delimiters that can be used are as below : 
 var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").split(',')  
 var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").split(';')  
 var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").split('/')  
 var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").split(' ')  
 var1, var2 = input("enter two numbers:").

 If you need to take two integers say a,b in python you can use map function. 
Suppose input is, 

 
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
 

 where 1 represent test case, 5 represent number of values and 3 represents a task value and in next line given 5 values, we can take such input using this method in PYTH 2.x Version. 

  testCases=int(raw_input())
number, taskValue = map(int, raw_input().split())
array = map(int, raw_input().split())
  

 You can replace 'int' in map() with another datatype needed.

 One liner :) 

  >>> [f(i) for f,i in zip((int, float), raw_input().split())]
1 1.2
[1, 1.2]

 The solution I found is the following: 

 

 Ask the user to enter two numbers separated by a comma or other character 

  value = input("Enter 2 numbers (separated by a comma): ")  

 Then, the string is split:  n  takes the first value and  m  the second one 

  n,m = value.split(',')  

 Finally, to use them as integers, it is necessary to convert them 

  n, m = int(n), int(m)

 this will work: 

  split = input_values.split()
id1 = int(split[0])
id2 = int(split[-1])
name = " ".join(split[1:-1])

 You can't really do it the C way (I think) but a pythonic way of doing this would be (if your 'inputs' have spaces in between them): 

  raw_answer = raw_input()
answers = raw_answer.split(' ') # list of 'answers'
  

 So you could rewrite your try to: 

  var1, var2 = raw_input("enter two numbers:").split(' ')
  

 Note that this it somewhat less flexible than using the 'first' solution (for example if you add a space at the end this will already break). 

 Also be aware that var1 and var2 will still be strings with this method when not cast to int.
