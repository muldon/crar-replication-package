  os.path.getsize(filename)
  

 It should return the size of a file, reported by os.stat().

 Try to take a look at http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.getsize 

 
   os.path.getsize(path) Return the size,
  in bytes, of path. Raise os.error if
  the file does not exist or is
  inaccessible. 
 

  import os
os.path.getsize('C:\\Python27\\Lib\\genericpath.py')
  

   

  os.stat('C:\\Python27\\Lib\\genericpath.py').st_size

 for getting the size of one file, there is os.path.getsize() 

  >>> import os
>>> os.path.getsize("/path/file")
35L
  

 its reported in bytes.

 In case of an upload field like  <input type="file" name="foo"/>  in the HTML page,  request.files['foo']  gives you an object, which has an integer attribute called  content_length . This is the size of the uploaded file in bytes, see example usage here: https://github.com/dnet/photochecklist/blob/5072331/model.py#L78

 The file name attribute  is not accurate  to display file size correctly. As I understand it, it's updated when the file is viewed in Windows explorer because the file name attribute is part of the INDX blocks for folders. So it's easier when you navigate to show what you have in the directory tree than to re-parse the file record to find it's size. There are also other sizes in the file name attribute structure that refer to the attribute's name and the actual file name size. 

 The accurate size of the file is given by the DATA attribute (type 0x80) and a file might have multiple data attributes. The unnamed DATA attributes are the main content of the file.

 You can use  os.stat(path)  call

 Ftplib can get the size of a file before downloading. As the documentation says: 

 
   FTP.size(filename)
  Request the size of
  the file named filename on the server.
  On success, the size of the file is
  returned as an integer, otherwise None
  is returned.  Note that the SIZE
  command is not standardized, but is
  upported by many common server
  implementations  
 

 Apparently your server doesn't support this feature.

 You may use  os.stat()  function, which is a wrapper of system call  stat() : 

  import os

def getSize(filename):
    st = os.stat(filename)
    return st.st_size

 You're on Windows, and your file presumably contains 204 (11264-11060) carriage return-linefeed pairs, which when read in text mode are normalized to a single linefeed ( \n ) character.  Use binary mode ( 'rb' ) to avoid this conversion.
