 Split on any whitespace, then join on a single space. 

  ' '.join(s.split())

 I would use Django's  slugify  method, which condenses spaces into a single dash and other helpful features: 

  from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify

  "electric guitar".split()  will give you  ['electric', 'guitar'] . So will  "electric   \tguitar" .

 Using  re ... 

  import re

s = b"This is        a small         world"

s = re.sub(r'(.*\bsmall *)\t+( *world\b.*)', r'\1\t\2', s)

print s
  

 Output: 

  >>> 
This is          a small     world
  

 This will keep all spaces before and after the two  tabs .

 In addition, https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html has some variations: 

  Remove spaces in the BEGINNING and END of a string:  

  sentence= sentence.strip()
  

  Remove spaces in the BEGINNING of a string:  

  sentence = sentence.lstrip()
  

  Remove spaces in the END of a string:  

  sentence= sentence.rstrip()
  

 All three string functions  strip   lstrip , and  rstrip  can take parameters of the string to strip, with the default being all white space. This can be helpful when you are working with something particular, for example, you could remove only spaces but not newlines: 

  " 1. Step 1\n".strip(" ")
  

 Or you could remove extra commas when reading in a string list: 

  "1,2,3,".strip(",")

 Use this for removing all white space at once: 

  import re

s = ' as fa   sdf sdfsdf '
s = re.sub(r'\s+', '', s)

s
=> 'asfasdfsdfsdf'
  

 The advantage of this approach is that it eliminates all the spaces in-between characters - one, two, no matter how many there are, because the regular expression  r'\s+'  matches "one or more" whitespace characters - including spaces, tabs, etc.

 The below regex would replace consecutive tabs or spaces with a single whitespace. Note that, it won't convert a single tab into a space. 

  formatted_string = re.sub("[\t ]{2,}", " ", formatted_string)
