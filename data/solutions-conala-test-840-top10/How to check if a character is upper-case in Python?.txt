Query: How to check if a character is upper-case in Python?

 To test that all words start with an upper case use this: 

  print all(word[0].isupper() for word in words)

  x="Alpha_beta_Gamma"
is_uppercase_letter = True in map(lambda l: l.isupper(), x)
print is_uppercase_letter
>>>>True
  

 So you can write it in 1 string

 Maybe you want https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.istitle 

  >>> help(str.istitle)
Help on method_descriptor:

istitle(...)
    S.istitle() -> bool

    Return True if S is a titlecased string and there is at least one
    character in S, i.e. uppercase characters may only follow uncased
    characters and lowercase characters only cased ones. Return False
    otherwise.

>>> "Alpha_beta_Gamma".istitle()
False
>>> "Alpha_Beta_Gamma".istitle()
True
>>> "Alpha_Beta_GAmma".istitle()
False

 You can use this regex: 

  ^[A-Z][a-z]*(?:_[A-Z][a-z]*)*$
  

 Sample code: 

  import re

strings = ["Alpha_beta_Gamma", "Alpha_Beta_Gamma"]
pattern = r'^[A-Z][a-z]*(?:_[A-Z][a-z]*)*$'

for s in strings:
    if re.match(pattern, s):
        print s + " conforms"
    else:
        print s + " doesn't conform"

 Here are some hints to help you figure it out. 

 To get a single letter from a string subscript the string. 

  >>> 'abcd'[2]
'c'
  

 Note that the first character is character zero, the second character is character one, and so forth. 

 The next thing to note is that an upper case letter does not compare equal to a lower case letter: 

  >>> 'a' == 'A'
False
  

 Luckily, python strings have the methods  upper  and  lower  to change the case of a string: 

  >>> 'abc'.upper()
'ABC'
>>> 'a' == 'A'.lower()
True
  

 To test for membership in a list us  in : 

  >>> 3 in [1, 2, 3]
True
>>> 8 in [1, 2, 3]
False
  

 So in order to solve your problem, tie together subscripting to get a single letter,   upper / lower  to adjust case, and testing for membership using  in .

 Is this what you're looking for? 

  >>> "how now brown cow".title()
'How Now Brown Cow'

 Problem 

 
   why this one doesn't work? 
 

 Along with having syntax errors and run-time errors, you code's logic is quite a ways off. You are actual not doing what the question asked. You seem to be trying to count the number of uppercase characters in a single character. That's incorrect. 

 Let's look back over the question to implement this correctly: 

 
   Write a Python function  that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters . Sample String :  'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'  Expected Output : No. of Upper case characters :  4  No. of Lower case Characters :  33 . 
 

 Ok, so we have a clear definition of our problem. Given a single string, count the number of lower case characters the string contains, and uppercase characters the string contains. Let's start writing our function. 

 First we should define a function: 

  def count_upper_and_lower(string):
  

 I know we'll need two variables; How? Because we need one to count the uppercase letters, and one to count the lowercase letters. So let's initialize those: 

  def count_upper_lower(string):
    lowercase_letter_count = 0
    uppercase_letter_count = 0
  

   Well the problem says to   count each letter in the string  . It sounds like we need to iterate over each character in the string. So we should use a  for  loop: 

  def count_upper_lower(string):
    lowercase_letter_count = 0
    uppercase_letter_count = 0

    for letter in string:
  

 OK, so what logic do we need in our for loop? Well we need to first check if a letter is upper case. If it is, we need to increment  uppercase_letter_count . If not, we'll then test if the character is lowercase. If so, we'll increment  lowercase_letter_count . Otherwise, we'll do nothing. Here is what that would look like in code: 

  if letter.isupper():
    uppercase_letter_count += 1
elif letter.islower():
    lowercase_letter_count += 1
  

 Let's add that to our  for  loop: 

  def count_upper_lower(string):
    lowercase_letter_count = 0
    uppercase_letter_count = 0

    for letter in string:
        if letter.isupper():
            uppercase_letter_count += 1
        elif letter.islower():
            lowercase_letter_count += 1
  

 . All that's left to do is to print the values at the end of the function: 

  def count_upper_lower(string):
    lowercase_letter_count = 0
    uppercase_letter_count = 0

    for letter in string:
        if letter.isupper():
            uppercase_letter_count += 1
        elif letter.islower():
            lowercase_letter_count += 1

    print uppercase_letter_count, lowercase_letter_count
  

  

  def count_upper_lower(string):
    lowercase_letter_count = 0
    uppercase_letter_count = 0

    for letter in string:
        if letter.isupper():
            uppercase_letter_count += 1
        elif letter.islower():
            lowercase_letter_count += 1

    print uppercase_letter_count, lowercase_letter_count


count_upper_lower("Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?")
# Output: 4 33
count_upper_lower("The FAT Cat Moaned AlL day!")
# Output: 8 13

 You can use this code: 

  def is_valid(string):
    words = string.split('_')
    for word in words:
        if not word.istitle():
            return False, word
    return True, words
x="Alpha_beta_Gamma"
assert is_valid(x)==(False,'beta')
x="Alpha_Beta_Gamma"
assert is_valid(x)==(True,['Alpha', 'Beta', 'Gamma'])
  

 This way you know if is valid and what word is wrong

 You could use regular expressions: 

  all_uppercase = bool(re.match(r'[A-Z]+$', word))
