  >>> import os
>>> os.system('cd c:\mydir')
  

 In fact,  os.system()  can execute any command that windows command prompt can execute, not just change dir.

 you should execute "Anaconda Prompt" and then you can start "python" from there. 

 it is not recommended to "add to path" during Anaconda installation on Windows 10. So, it's normal python from Anaconda is not in your path.

 Add the keyword  start  before the command to execute it in a new prompt. 

 to open the python interactive shell in a new cmd prompt. 

  start python
  

 to execute a python file  new.py  in a new cmd prompt. 

  start python new.py
  

  EDIT:  

 here is the complete code to execute the scripts on different cmd prompts 

  @echo off
echo "this is the main batch script"
for /d %%i in (C:\Test\*) do (
start python "%%i\example.py"
)
pause

 You should remove the leading: 

  /bin/sh
  

 Your current script does two things:
1) execute a new instance of /bin/sh
==> which gives your the shell $ sign 

 2) execute the python script 

 Your script should be:  

  python ~/Documents/Projects/Programming/Python/svg/svg2dxf.py $1 0

 There are two prominent ways in which one can execute shell commands using Python. Both the below mentioned examples show how one can get the name of present working directory ( pwd ) using Python. You can use any other Unix command in place of  pwd .  

  1.> 1st method:  One can use the https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html module from python, and https://www.journaldev.com/16140/python-system-command-os-subprocess-call function from there to execute shell commands in Python. 

  import os
os.system('pwd')
  

 Output: 

  /Users/siddharth
  

  1.> 2nd method:  Another way is to use the https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html module and https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/subprocess.html function.  

  import subprocess
subprocess.call('pwd')
  

 Output: 

  /Users/siddharth

 If you're running http://ipython.scipy.g/ (which I highly recommend f interactive python sessions), you can type: 

  %run filename 
  

  

  %run filename.py
  

 to execute the module (rather than impting it). You'll get file-name completion, which is great f ReallyLongModuleName.py (not that you'd name your modules like that  anything).
